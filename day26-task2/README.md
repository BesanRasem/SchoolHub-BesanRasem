Testing with Postman

I used Postman to test all CRUD endpoints for students (/api/students).
I tried all operations: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE to make sure the server works correctly. 
Note: The deadline was 11/2, and I completed it before the due date.
I also attached screenshots showing the requests and responses in Postman.
